# Welcome to AccessMap

AccessMap is a web application that allows users to view a location's accessibilty rating prior to their visit. Ratings are given on a 5-point scale (where 0 is least accessible and 5 is most accessible). There are multiple categories such as:

- Sensory Rating
  - Rates a location based on tendency for sensory overload (sight, smell, hearing, et cetra)
- Mobility Rating
  - Rates how difficult the terrain is to navigate (slopes, uneven pavement, accessible parking, curb cuts, et cetra)
- Service Dog Relief Rating
  - Rates presence of appropriate places for service dogs to relieve themselves (i.e. grass, mulch, pebbles or dirt without landscaping or gardening that could be damaged, access to poop bags and trash cans, et cetra)
- Weelchair Accessibility Rating
  - Rates a location based on wheelchair accessibility (elevators with space, accessible parking, accessible bathroom stalls)
- Common Allergen Rating
  - Rates a location based on pressence of common allergens (i.e. tree nuts, gluten, et cetra) and their protective measures against cross-contamination (if any)
